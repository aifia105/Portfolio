                    <p>I am a passionate full-stack developer based in Tunisia. My interest in web development started back in 2016 when I got my first personal computer.
                         Fast-forward to today: I studied computer sciences in university and got my bachelor degree. <br>
                        <br>
                        What sets me apart is that I am extremely motivated to constantly develop my skills and to evolve professionally. <br>
                        I'm known for my expertise in both front-end and back-end development and a deep understanding of web technologies, databases, and APIs. <br>
                        <br>
